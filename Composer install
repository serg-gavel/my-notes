All settings correct for using Composer Unable to write keys.dev.pub to: /home/ubuntu/.composer

Step 1: just go to your Project Directory and run a Command sudo su

Step 2: then Try to install the Composer using The Following Command

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

potom dvigaem etu huetu

mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

sudo apt-get install php-zip

eJust adding to the accepted answer...

In case you are executing the commands directly on the terminal (in which case the path will remain available till the terminal window or tab closes)

If you mess up the earlier path, you need to open and close the terminal window (or tab)

Example:

first execute (mess up the path in someway)

PATH="test"
then execute

PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"
You will still get the error Now close the terminal window or tab and reopen it and execute

PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"
And the error should be gone!
